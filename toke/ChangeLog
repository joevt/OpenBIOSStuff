*** Changes by joevt

 * These changes from OpenBIOS-0.99.1 have been made over the last 20 years.
   It was first implemented as an MPW tool compiled by CodeWarrior 7.
   The MPW scripts and CodeWarrior projects are no longer maintained.

 * Changes to Makefile.
 * Added CodeWarrior 7 build.
 * Added 0x129 push-package
 * Added 0x12a pop-package
 * Added 0x168 foreground-color
 * Added 0x169 background-color
 * Added my-parent synonym for 0x20a my-package
 * Added special token: instance
 * Added special token: binary
 * Added special token: b#
 * Added pci-architecture . 
 * Added pci-data-structure-start .
 * Added pci-data-structure-length .
 * Added set-vpd-offset .
 * Added rom-size .
 * ?leave is a macro, not a special.
 * emit_byte doesn't need 0xff mask.
 * emit_offset will warn when offset is out of range.
 * Numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, -1 will be output as their fcode instead of as b(lit). Same for CONTROL special.
 * d stack includes type for each element, so we can be sure we pop the expected type.
 * PCI Class Code is a 24 bit number with class as most significant byte. It is written to PCI header as class/subclass/interface.
 * firstchar stops at null character.
 * get_until increments character pointer to beyond the character that was being searched for.
 * get_sequence allows white space before and after and between hex bytes of string.
 * get_string doesn't allow back-slash as escape character (match Apple Open Firmware behavior).
 * get_string checks for terminating null character.
 * get_string doesn't skip the character that is after the character that is after an escape quote " .
 * Added lower case option to make all words lower case (as they exist in Mac ROMs)
 * Fixed all endof offsets (calculated when endcase is encountered).
 * Fix .( ...) and s" ..." so that the last character is not excluded.
 * fcode-end finishes the fcode header.
 * Assume unknown tokens exist. This allows the tokenizer to find other errors instead of just stopping.
 * Stack errors show file line number.
 * init_stream don't do weird things to characters > ascii 0x80.
 * Return status -1 if error occurs.
 * Remembers how a token is defined so a errors can be reported for operations on tokens of the wrong type.
   Report when "to" is applied to a VARIABLE or CONST or anything else.
   Report when "instance" is applied to a token that is not a VALUE, VARIABLE, DEFER, or BUFFER.
