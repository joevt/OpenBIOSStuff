1. What is the OpenBIOS tokenizer?
   toke is a GPLed FCode tokenizer. It can tokenize (assemble) fcode
   source to bytecode files as described by the IEEE 1275-1994 standard.
   This program aims towards IEEE 1275-1994 compliancy, but there is
   no warranty that it is actually compliant.
   Bytecode files normally contain Open Firmware drivers or other 
   packages for use with an Open Firmware compliant system.
   
2. What is required to build the OpenBIOS tokenizer?
   toke should build with any ANSI compliant C compiler.
   To build toke on other platforms you might have to adjust the 
   Makefile.
   To build toke, just enter "make". To clean up an existing build, 
   use "make clean" or "make distclean"
   
3. How to use the OpenBIOS tokenizer
   tokenize an fcode source file with 
	toke [-v|--verbose] [-i|--ignore-errors] <file.4th> [<file2.4th>]
	
   Get help with:
	toke [-h|--help]

   The file extension will be changed to .fc. If no file extension 
   exists, .fc will be appended. If -i is specified, toke continues
   on errors, producing invalid fcode binaries.

4. Special Features not included in IEEE 1275-1994
   In addition to the standard Open Firmware words, some additional
   feature words have been added to make life easier. These are:

4.1 NEXT-FCODE
   In tokenizer[ .. ]tokenizer context there is an additional control
   word besides emit-byte: next-fcode. It sets the increasing fcode 
   number used to emit new fcode words to the specified value.
   This could look like follows:
   -------------------------------------------
       \ next emitted fcode is 0x053, 2dup.
       tokenizer[ 053 next-fcode ]tokenizer
       \ now define the word.
       : 2dup over over ;
   -------------------------------------------
   Thus, toke is capable of creating fcode files that implement words
   defined by the IEEE 1275-1994 standard itself.
   
4.2 FCODE-VERSION2
   This word generates an FCode header using START1. It should be used 
   with FCODE-END.
   
4.3 FCODE-END
   This word creates an END0 FCode and fixes up the FCode header 
   information. Use this with FCODE-VERSION2

4.4 PCI-HEADER
   This word creates a PCI option ROM header. PCI-HEADER expects 3 
   values on the top of the stack when it is invoked: Vendor#, Device# 
   and Class-Code.
   These values are used for the according fields in the PCI Data
   structure that is emitted by PCI-HEADER.  To include these values
   put them on the stack with TOKENIZER[ and ]TOKENIZER.

4.5 PCI-END / PCI-HEADER-END
   This word completes the PCI header created by PCI-HEADER. It fills out
   the image to a multiple of 512 bytes, and sets the missing values in 
   the PCI header (image-length, revision).

   Example:
   HEX
   TOKENIZER[ 1234 5678 ABCDEF ]TOKENIZER
   PCI-HEADER \ generate PCI option rom header
	FCODE-VERSION2 \ generate FCode header (within PCI image)
        ...
        ...
	FCODE-END \ terminate FCode in image
   PCI-END \ complete the PCI header and image.
   
   
4.6 PCI-REVISION / SET-REV-LEVEL
   Use this word to change the revision field of the PCI header. Like 
   PCI-HEADER, PCI-REVISION takes it's value from the stack. You can
   write: TOKENIZER[ 23 ]TOKENIZER PCI-REVISION

4.7 NOT-LAST-IMAGE
   Normally Toke assumes that a PCI image generated by PCI-HEADER is
   the only ROM image in the (EEP)ROM it will be written to. With 
   NOT-LAST-IMAGE Toke sets a flag in the PCI header that other images 
   will follow in the same ROM.

4.8 FCODE-DATE
   FCODE-DATE creates an FCode string that contains the date of the 
   tokenization. This string could be used to create a device tree 
   property that can be inspected by  drivers, etc. to check when the 
   image was created. The format of the string emitted by FCODE-DATE 
   is MM/DD.YYYY

4.9 FCODE-TIME
   FCODE-TIME creates an FCode string that contains the time of the 
   tokenization.  This string could be used to create a device tree 
   property that can be inspected by drivers, etc. to check when the
   image was created. The format of the string emitted by FCODE-TIME 
   is HH:MM:SS
   
4.10 ENCODE-FILE
   encode a binary file. Use as: encode-file filename

 
5. Text Strings

   From "Writing FCode":
   Escape Sequences in Text Strings

   -----------------------------------------------------------
   Syntax          Function
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   ""              quote (")
   "n              newline
   "r              carriage return
   "t              tab
   "f              formfeed
   "l              linefeed
   "b              backspace
   "!              bell
   "^x             control x, where x is any printable 
                   character
   "(hh hh)        Sequence of bytes, one byte for each pair
                   of hex digits hh . Non-hex characters will
                   be ignored 

   " followed by any other printable character not mentioned
   above is equivalent to that character.

   "( means to start parsing pairs of hexadecimal digits as
   one or more 8-bit characters in the range 0x00 through
   0xFF, delimited by a trailing ) and ignoring
   non-hexadecimal digits between pairs of hexadecimal
   digits. Both uppercase and lowercase hexadecimal digits are
   recognized. Since non-hex characters (such as space or
   comma) are ignored between "( and ), these characters make
   useful delimiters. (The "makearray" tool can be used in
   conjunction with this syntax to easily incorporate large
   binary data fields into any FCode Program.)

   Any characters thus recognized are appended to any previous
   text in the string being assembled. After the ) is
   recognized, text assembly continues until a trailing
   "<whitespace>.

   For example:

   " This is "(01 32,8e)abc"nA test! "!"! abcd""hijk"^bl"
               ^^^^^^^^    ^         ^ ^      ^      ^
                3 bytes    newline   2 bells  "      control b
