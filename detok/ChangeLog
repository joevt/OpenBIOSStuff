*** Changes by joevt

 * These changes from OpenBIOS-0.99.1 have been made over the last 20 years.
   It was first implemented as an MPW tool compiled by CodeWarrior 6.
   The MPW scripts and CodeWarrior projects are no longer maintained.

 * Changes to Makefile.
 * Changes to dump fcode images and compiled fcode from Mac ROMs and compiled dictionaries captured from Mac RAM.
 * Added use tabs option (for indent - instead of 4 spaces).
 * Added ignore length option. Allows detokenizing beyond the end of an fcode image since Mac ROMs have multiple fcode images.
 * Added Mac ROM type option. Affects interpretation of some fcodes.
 * Added Mac ROM start option. Affects calculated addresses of compiled fcode.
 * Allows line numbers and offsets to be output at the same time.
 * Outputs list of fcodes that are historical (H.2) and new (H.4).
 * For string literals, NIL does not terminate the string.
 * For string literals, if any character is NIL and len >= 252 or any character is not printable ASCII (excluding NIL) or tab then assume all bytes are hex.
 * For string literals, output mix of hex and ASCII as a string that can be accepted by Open Firmware and toke .
 * Added line numbers to error messages.
 * Unnamed fcodes will output unnamed_fcode_ with fcode number appended instead of (unnamed-fcode)
 * Supports long offsets as used by lb?branch and lbbranch tokens of newer Mac ROMs. These are 16-bit regardless of the current offs16 setting.
   These long branches don't come with a b(>resolve) or b(<mark) token so we add them virtually.
 * If an 8-bit offset is 0 then it's probably an error so we switch to 16-bit offsets and try that.
 * If a token name is bad, ignore the name and reset position to start of name.
 * Validate length start fcode before attempting to verify checksum.
 * Verify that indent of ; and endcase tokens matches indent of corresponding : and case tokens.
 * Supports local variables used by fcode of Mac ROMs.
 * Supports code,s token of newer Mac ROMs.
   This is always used during fcode interpreting mode and is not compilable during compile mode so the (see) command
   doesn't show what it looks like as Forth so just output it as a series of 32-bit hex literals surrounded by code<<< >>>>
 * detok uses two passes so that it can handle forward offsets in Mac ROMs.
 * Make sure file length is reasonable (less than 2GB).
 * When a token is added, report it and include whether it is a predefined token. Mac ROMs will define predefined tokens.
   When a token is added, include in the report the token category (historical, new, reserved, vendor unique, program defined, extended range, and negative range)
   When a token is added, include in the report whether it is defined, or redefined.
   Report when a token is renamed. Report attempts to unname a token.
   In a Mac ROM there are multiple separate fcode images and fcode numbers are reused.
   Sometimes, a reused fcode has the same name. Sometimes, the name is different.
   These are not usually errors.
 * Renamed 0x0dd compile to compile,
 * Renamed 0x122 memory-test-issue to memory-test-suite
 * Added 0x129 push-package
 * Added 0x12a pop-package
 * Added 0x168 foreground-color
 * Added 0x169 background-color
 * Renamed 0x20a my-package to my-parent
 * get_byte should not read beyond end of buffer.
 * Supports 16-bit fcode numbers for newer Mac ROMs instead of 12-bit.
 * get_offset should return a signed number.
 * get_string should allow strings that contain NIL characters which means it should also return a length.
