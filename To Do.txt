1)
Add code for parsing the device tree pointers (properties and methods) for DumpMacRom / detok.
For details, search for "device entry" in "ROM PowerPC Mac/ROM G5 Quad/compiled fcode/my notes/All.txt"

2)
Create a script to convert PowerPC assembly to tokens like the (see) command in Open Firmware.

3)
Add ability to tokenize Mac ROM Open Firmware local variables and anything else required for Mac ROM fcode images.
This is stuff not used in PCI option ROM fcode images which toke handles perfectly already.
