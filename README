detok - Source code for detok command.
Detokenizes fcode images and disassembles compiled PowerPC parts of Mac Open Firmware ROMs.

toke - Source code for toke command.
Converts Forth to an fcode image or a PCI expansion ROM fcode image.

MPW - MPW tools and scripts. Read more in the Worksheet file.
These are included only for historical purposes. They are not maintained.

macOS - Tools and scripts updated for macOS (tested in Monterey).
The worksheet shows how to compile detok and toke.

Joe's Stuff - Source code files that do not exist in the original OpenBIOS source code.
They are used to compile the MPW versions of detok and toke.

Test - Scripts to do testing. Sample input files for the scripts. Output files produced by the scripts.

Original source code for detok and toke is from http://www.openbios.info/bin/OpenBIOS-0.99.1.tar.bz2
Many changes were made since then to add features or fix problems. See the ChangeLogs.
Maybe some of the problems were fixed in later versions of the OpenBIOS code.

detok and toke were updated for macOS. The changes probably broke MPW compatibility.
detok now uses the capstone library for PowerPC disassembly of Mac Open Firmware ROMs.
capstone has bugs (at least for PowerPC disassembly) for which detok has many workarounds
which should now produce results at least as good as those produced using the disassembler
library included in the CodeWarrior project. For macOS, capstone can be installed using
Homebrew.
